Considerations:

The activities and projects do not have any unique ID's which is what I would like to be passing between front and back end instead of the actual names and times.
This way we prevent client tampering with the data as all numbers data being processed is server side.

If sending the POST request returned the updated projects.json, then the rendering of the Visual could be tied to that instead of having my hacky solution of reassignment.

If I could do this again I would edit how the data is sent to the backend to only send the updated project instead of the WHOLE projects.json file.

Maybe add styling to the activity component based on the color of the selected project
